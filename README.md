## 📖 Overview

**CDP/VIP (Cognitive Data Protocol / Value Interchange Protocol)** is a decentralized, open-source infrastructure designed to bridge the gap between **Human Intuition (Carbon)** and **Machine Intelligence (Silicon)**. 

As AI models face the "Data Wall" and the risks of model collapse from synthetic data, the CDP/VIP protocol provides a secure, private, and peer-to-peer way for humans to contribute their live cognitive streams to the evolution of intelligence—and be fairly compensated for it.

## 🏗 Architecture 

The protocol is built on three minimalist, high-performance layers:


1.  **CDP (Cognitive Data Protocol)**: Standardizes how raw cognitive signals (logic, focus, emotion) are captured and hardware-attested via TEE.
    
2.  **VRP (Value Refinery Protocol)**: A community-driven layer for structuring and labeling raw data into AI-ready training packets.
   
3.  **VIP (Value Interchange Protocol)**: An algorithmic settlement engine for streaming, intermediary-free wealth redistribution.

## 🚀 Why CDP/VIP? |

* **Anti-Exploitation**: We return data sovereignty to the individual. No more free harvesting by tech giants.

* **Privacy-First**: Your raw data never leaves your "Secure Enclave." AI learns from it, but never "owns" it.

* **Economic Equity**: Enabling **Universal Cognitive Income (UCI)**. As AI creates wealth, the contributors get paid.

## 💰 Tokenomics (The $COG Engine)

The CDP/VIP protocol is powered by **$COG**, a deflationary utility token with a **fixed supply of 1 Billion**. 


- **Produce to Mint**: Generating high-entropy cognitive data is the only way to bring tokens into circulation.
- **Consume to Burn**: AI manufacturers must buy and **burn** $COG to access human wisdom, creating a natural appreciation of value.
