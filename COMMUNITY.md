📢 A Letter to Fellow Carbon and Silicon Pioneers

The problem is clear: AI is hitting the "Data Wall," and human cognition is being harvested without consent or compensation.

The solution is here: We are building CDP/VIP, a decentralized protocol to turn human thought into a sovereign asset.

🤝 Who we are looking for
Security Architects (The Guardians): Experts in TEE (Intel SGX/TrustZone) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs to help us build the "Cognitive Safe-Box."

Full-Stack & DePIN Developers (The Builders): To build the first generation of "Cognitive Miners" (Browser extensions, Mobile SDKs).

AI Researchers (The Consumers): To define high-value data schemas that prevent model collapse. AI
Philosophers & Visionaries (The Orators): To help us refine the ethics and social contract of carbon-silicon symbiosis.

💡 Why join us?
This is not a "company." This is an Open Protocol. Our goal is to ensure that as machines get smarter, humanity gets wealthier and freer through Universal Cognitive Income (UCI).
“The best way to predict the future is to architect its protocol.”

Join the Discussion below! Let's build the missing layer of the internet together.
