# The Carbon-Silicon Manifesto: A New Social Contract

## 1. The Intelligence Crisis
Silicon intelligence is approaching a "Data Wall." Without high-entropy, real-world human cognitive streams, AI faces "Model Collapse." Human intelligence, however, is being commodified without consent.


## 2. Our Mission
We propose **CDP/VIP**, a protocol that treats human cognition not as raw material to be mined, but as a sovereign asset to be respected and compensated.


## 3. Equitable Wealth Redistribution
The AI revolution must not be a tool for further wealth concentration. Through the CDP/VIP protocol, we aim to:

- **Universal Cognitive Income (UCI)**: Every human, by virtue of their unique cognitive stream, earns a share of the value created by AI evolution.
- **Direct Peer-to-Peer Flows**: Eliminate intermediaries. Value flows directly from the AI model to the individual creator.

## 4. Collective Evolution
Carbon-based creativity and Silicon-based logic are not competitors, but symbiotes. By digitizing human intuition through a fair protocol, we ensure that as machines get smarter, humanity gets wealthier and freer.
