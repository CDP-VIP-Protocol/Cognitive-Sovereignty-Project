# The Carbon-Silicon Manifesto: A New Social Contract


## 1. The Intelligence Crisis
Silicon intelligence is approaching a "Data Wall." Without high-entropy, real-world human cognitive streams, AI faces "Model Collapse." Human intelligence, however, is being commodified without consent.


## 2. Our Mission
We propose **CDP/VIP**, a protocol that treats human cognition not as raw material to be mined, but as a sovereign asset to be respected and compensated.


## 3. Cognitive Sovereignty
Every spark of thought carries intrinsic value. Through decentralized attestation (TEE) and peer-to-peer exchange, we return the power of intelligence to its rightful creators.
