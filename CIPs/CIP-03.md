# CIP-03: Privacy Shield & Security Standards


## Status: Draft 

### 1. Objective
To ensure that human cognitive data remains under the user's control and that AI consumers can only "learn" from the data without ever "owning" or "leaking" the raw information.


### 2. The "Black Box" Principle (TEE)
The CDP/VIP protocol mandates the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEE).

- **Hardware-Level Isolation**: Raw data is only decrypted inside a hardware-isolated environment (e.g., Intel SGX, Apple Secure Enclave).
- **Zero Raw Data Export**: AI models can only export "trained weights" or "gradients." Exporting raw cognitive packets is mathematically impossible.

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
To verify the quality of data without revealing its content.

- **Proof of Humanity**: Prove the data is generated by a real human without revealing their identity.

- **Proof of Task**: Prove the data is relevant to the training task (e.g., actually solving a bug) without exposing the specific code logic if not required.


### 4. Local Differential Privacy
Before data leaves the user's terminal, noise is added to sensitive attributes to prevent deanonymization.
