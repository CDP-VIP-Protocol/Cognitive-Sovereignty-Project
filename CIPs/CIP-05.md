# CIP-05: The "Mint-and-Burn" Economic Engine


## Status: Draft 

### 1. Abstract 
This proposal defines the value flow of the $COG token. It introduces a deflationary model where data production is the only way to "mint" value, and AI data consumption is the only way to "burn" (destroy) it.


### 2. Market-Driven Pricing
To ensure a fair income for "yuan" and all contributors, we establish a **Baseline Protocol Price (BPP)**:

- **Expert Reasoning Data (e.g., Senior Coding)**: Recommended at **$50 USD equivalent in $COG per 1MB**.
- **Justification**: This ensures expert-level compensation that exceeds traditional centralized labeling platforms by removing middleman fees.


### 3. The Economic Loop
1. **Production (Minting)**: Human producers generate verified packets. The protocol issues $COG tokens to their DID wallets.
2. **Subscription (Staking)**: AI Manufacturers buy $COG from the open market.
3. **Usage (Burning)**: Each time an AI model trains on a packet, the required amount of $COG is **permanently burned**.


### 4. Scarcity & Growth
As the demand for high-entropy human data increases, the total circulating supply of $COG will shrink, creating a natural appreciation for early adopters and long-term contributors.
