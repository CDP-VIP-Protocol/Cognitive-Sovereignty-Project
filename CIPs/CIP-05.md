# CIP-05: Native Tokenomics & The Burn-and-Mint Settlement Engine


## Status: Draft

### 1. Objective 
To create a self-sustaining economic loop where human cognition is the primary source of value. By using a native token with a fixed supply and a burn mechanism, we ensure that the protocol's value grows alongside the AI's intelligence.


### 2. Token Symbol: $COG (Cognitive Token) 
- **Total Supply**: Fixed (e.g., 1,000,000,000 $COG). No inflation after the genesis phase.
- **Network**: High-throughput, Low-fee L1/L2 (e.g., Solana or AppChain) to ensure near-zero transaction costs.


### 3. The "Mint-and-Burn" Cycle

#### A. Proof of Cognition (Minting/Mining)
- **Process**: When a Producer generates a verified "Cognitive Packet" (CIP-01), the protocol "mints" (or releases from a reserve) $COG tokens as a reward.
- **Value Origin**: Data is stored and indexed, waiting for AI consumers.

#### B. Data Consumption (Burning) 
- **Process**: To access or train on a specific data stream, AI Manufacturers must purchase $COG from the market and "Burn" them into a non-retrievable address.
- **Result**: The circulating supply of $COG decreases, creating a natural deflationary pressure.

### 4. Price Discovery & Pricing Range
- **Market Driven**: The price of $COG is determined by the open market (DEX).
- **Dynamic Pricing**: The cost to "unlock" a data packet is set in "Cognitive Units," which the protocol converts to $COG based on current market rates.

### 5. Settlement Engine (VIP-Core) | 结算引擎核心
- **Streaming Payments**: Credits are deducted in real-time as the AI consumes data bits.
- **流式支付**: 随着 AI 消费数据，费用实时扣除，实现“所见即所得”的结算。
