# CIP-04: Decentralized Governance & DAO Structure


## Status: Draft

### 1. Objective
To ensure that the CDP/VIP protocol remains a public good, governed by the community of carbon-based contributors and silicon-based nodes, free from centralized capture.


### 2. The CDP-DAO Council
The protocol will be governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

- **Proposal Rights**: Any contributor who has produced more than 1,000 "Verified Cognitive Packets" has the right to submit a CIP.
- **Voting Power**: Governance power is distributed based on a mix of "Proof of Contribution" (Data Quality) and "Stake." We prioritize long-term data providers over pure financial speculators.


### 3. Adaptive Parameter Tuning
The DAO shall vote on critical protocol parameters including:

- **Distribution Ratios**: Adjusting the 75/15/8/2 split based on ecosystem maturity.

- **Reward Multipliers**: Deciding which types of cognitive data (e.g., medical, coding, emotional) currently receive higher incentives.


### 4. Open-Source Stewardship
All core codebases, smart contracts, and encryption schemas must remain open-source under the Apache 2.0 license. The DAO will fund "Security Audits" to ensure the protocol's integrity.
