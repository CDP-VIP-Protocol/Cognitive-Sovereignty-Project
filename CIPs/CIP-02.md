# CIP-02: Economic Model & Reward Distribution


## Status: Draft 

### 1. Objective
To establish a fair, transparent, and automated mechanism for redistributing the value created by Artificial Intelligence back to the human cognitive contributors.


### 2. The Genesis Split
For every unit of value (Token) paid by an AI Consumer, the protocol will automatically distribute it as follows:


- **Data Producer (Contributor): 75%** *The core human creator providing the cognitive stream.*
- **Data Refiner (Labeler): 15%** *Individuals or agents who structure and enhance the data quality.* 
- **Safety & Infrastructure Nodes: 8%** *Nodes providing the TEE blackbox and secure bandwidth.* 
- **Protocol DAO: 2%** *Reserved for open-source maintenance and future upgrades.* 

### 3. Demand-Driven Weighting
The protocol automatically adjusts reward weights based on AI market demand.

- **High Demand (e.g., Reasoning Data)**: Multiplier 2.0x 
- **Normal Supply**: Multiplier 1.0x

### 4. Settlement Mechanism
Value interchange occurs through the **VIP (Value Interchange Protocol)**, ensuring streaming payments with zero delay and zero intermediaries.
